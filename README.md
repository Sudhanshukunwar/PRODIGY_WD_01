navigation.ai 🚀

navigation.ai is a premium, high-performance single-page landing page concept designed with a focus on sophisticated navigation patterns and "human-crafted" interactivity. This project demonstrates how to blend modern Glassmorphism aesthetics with smooth, scroll-driven UI transformations.

🌟 Key Features

1. Intelligent Navigation System

Dynamic Styling: The fixed navigation bar transitions from a transparent "hero" state to a blurred glass-morphic state upon scrolling.

Active Section Tracking: Real-time JavaScript listeners monitor the viewport and automatically highlight the current menu item based on your position on the page.

Micro-Interactions: Custom underline animations and color shifts on hover provide immediate visual feedback to the user.

2. Immersive UI/UX

Smooth-Scroll Engine: Integrated anchor-point logic ensures fluid transitions between Home, About, Services, and Contact sections.

Glassmorphism Design: Utilizes backdrop-filter and semi-transparent layers to create a sense of depth and visual hierarchy.

Responsive Layout: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewing with a custom-coded mobile menu toggle.

3. "Non-AI" Aesthetic

Designed to move away from generic templates by utilizing custom spacing, fluid typography (Outfit & Inter), and organic background gradients that feel bespoke and professional.

🛠️ Built With

HTML5: Semantic structure for SEO and accessibility.

Tailwind CSS: For rapid, modern utility-first styling.

Vanilla JavaScript: Lightweight, dependency-free interactivity and scroll-event management.

Google Fonts: Integrated "Outfit" and "Inter" for a premium tech look.


📸 Interactive Showcase

Scroll Trigger: Watch the nav element add the .scrolled class at 50px scroll depth, triggering a transformation in height, background-blur, and border visibility.

Section Detection: Clicking "About" in the hero section or the navbar triggers a smooth-scroll event that lands the user perfectly on the target section with an offset for the fixed header.
